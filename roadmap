main back button is broken when using next and back buttons
also it doesnt even save the options, solution: pass all the options and scroll position
problem: scroll position may not work due to the scroll pagination i will implement later

css
mobile support
more filters (type, region, generation?)
sort
use pokeapi?


pokemon info page needs more info


add scroll pagination; when loading all the pokemon all at once it is very laggy
react-window for pagination

sidecard too small seems good now



checklist
fonts :check:
style buttons :check:
style filters :check:
make title bigger :check:
pokemon page titles need margin :check:


mobile styling
back button fix

scroll pagination, react-window

remove console.log, fix errors

refactor
